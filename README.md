## üìñ About

This repository is my **learning journal** as I work through the official  
[React.dev Learn Section](https://react.dev/learn). [X] indicates that task has been completed.

The goal is to practice **vanilla React** concepts ‚Äî components, props, state,  
context, effects ‚Äî and then apply them in capstone projects like  
**Thinking in React** and **Tic Tac Toe**.  

I‚Äôm keeping everything organized by lessons, with one React component per lesson,  
so progress is clear and easy to follow.

This repo is part of my nightly React practice routine (2‚Äì3 hours each night)
combined with project-based learning during the day.
